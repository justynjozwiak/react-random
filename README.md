React component for rendering random / fake data.

Often times we encounter the situation in our projects when we don't have any backend ready yet and we have to mock some random data in
our templates. That's why I've decided to create a simple React wrapper around [Faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) library called
`react-random` that solves our problem.

## Installation

Execute this line in your app directory:

```
npm install --save react-random
```

## Usage
